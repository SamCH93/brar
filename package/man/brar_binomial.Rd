\usage{
brar_binomial(
  y,
  n,
  a0 = 1,
  b0 = 1,
  a = rep(1, length(y)),
  b = rep(1, length(y)),
  pH0 = 0.5,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Vector with number of successes in each group. The first element
corresponds to the control group, and the remaining elements correspond
to the treatment groups}

\item{n}{Vector with number of trials in each group. The first element
corresponds to the control group, and the remaining elements correspond
to the treatment groups}

\item{a0}{Number of successes parameter of beta prior for common probability
under the null hypothesis. Defaults to \code{1}}

\item{b0}{Number of failures parameter of beta prior for common probability
under the null hypothesis. Defaults to \code{1}}

\item{a}{Vector of number of successes parameters of beta priors for
probabilities in each group under the alternative hypothesis. The first
element corresponds to the control group, and the remaining elements
correspond to the treatment groups. Defaults to \code{rep(1, length(y))}}

\item{b}{Vector of number of failures parameters of beta priors for
probabilities in each group under the alternative hypothesis. The first
element corresponds to the control group, and the remaining elements
correspond to the treatment groups. Defaults to \code{rep(1, length(y))}}

\item{pH0}{Prior probability of the null hypothesis (i.e., a common
probability in both groups). Defaults to \code{0.5}. Set to \code{0} to
obtain standard Thompson sampling and \code{1} to obtain equal
randomization}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{stats::integrate}}

\value{
An object of type \code{"brar"}
}
\description{
This function computes Bayes factors, posterior probabilities,
    and response adaptive randomization probabilities in the setting of
    binomial outcomes.

## 1 control and 1 treatment group
y <- c(10, 13)
n <- c(20, 21)

## 1 control and 5 treatment groups
